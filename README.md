## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in making a image classifier using Deep Neural Network.
This classifier uses flowers datatset as a default but can be generalized by making some changes.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are several files here:


1-cat-to-name.json:-json file used for encoding category number to real species name.

2-Image Classifier Project.html:- html file containing the complete step wise implementation of the project.

3-train.py- Python file used to train image classifier.Trained on flowers  dataset by default.

4-predict.py- Python file used to predict the classes of image..By deafult,it predicts the species of flower.

5-utils.py- Python helper file.

6-workspace_utils.py- Python file to keep workspace active.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The classifier can,by default,classify any flower's species.It can be used as a general image classifier by making some little bit of 
changes.
